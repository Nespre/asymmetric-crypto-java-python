# Cryptography Playground
This project explores multiple cryptographic algorithms — RSA, ElGamal, and ECDSA — through manual implementations and secure library-based approaches, in both Java and Python.

The goal is to deeply understand cryptographic principles by implementing everything from scratch before applying industry-grade libraries like BouncyCastle and Python cryptography.
